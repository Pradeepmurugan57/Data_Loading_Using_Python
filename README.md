ðŸ“– Data Access & Processing Approaches

In this project, we use two complementary methods to work with data stored in Snowflake:

Pandas (Python)

Pandas is a Python library that lets us handle data in a tabular format (like Excel, but more powerful).

Once data is pulled into a Pandas DataFrame, we can easily filter, group, and analyze it using Python code.

This is great for smaller datasets, quick experiments, and custom data transformations.

SQL inside Python

SQL (Structured Query Language) lets us process data directly inside the Snowflake database before bringing it into Python.

This is more scalable because the heavy computations (like filtering millions of rows or joining large tables) are handled by Snowflakeâ€™s compute engine.

We can embed SQL queries directly in Python code and then load the results into Pandas for further analysis.

Why Both?

SQL is efficient for handling large-scale data and doing the heavy lifting inside Snowflake.

Pandas is flexible for final touches, smaller datasets, and advanced analytics once the data is already filtered or summarized.

By combining both, we get the best of both worlds:

Fast, scalable processing with SQL.

Easy and flexible analysis with Pandas.
